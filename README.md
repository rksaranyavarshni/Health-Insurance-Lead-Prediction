# Health-Insurance-Lead-Prediction

Health insurance has become one of the inevitable
choices in one’s life. It is simply a way of paying
medical expenses or healthcare bills. In scenarios where
an individual cannot afford to pay his/ her healthcare
cost, health insurance dives in and helps them to pay off
their expenditure related to healthcare and allows them
to focus more on recovery instead of worrying about the
medical bills. There are public and several private health
insurance plans that help people to opt for plans that suit
their requirements and coverage.

Cross-selling is one of the best marketing strategies
where it involves the recommendation of related or
supplementary services in relevance to the customer’s
choice. Surveys prove that this type of selling strategy
improves customer relationships and the probability of
making an ordinary customer to a loyal one high. This
in turn will increase customer retention in a company by
improving the customer lifetime value.
FinMan now decides to use this cross-selling strategy
by recommendation of policies for healthcare insurance
based on the customer’s profile history. Once a customer
surfs through the policies offered and fills a registration
form, their interest in the healthcare insurance policies
is considered to be a positive signal and they are categorized
as lead or potential prospect for the policy sales.
Similarly, all the leads are populated together and a
policy sales advisor will approach the prospects to propose
health insurance policies. Thus, making an efficient
sales manner for the proposed policies.
